# Discovering Reliable Functional Dependencies

This is the implementation for discovering reliable dependencies from data using the reliable fraction of information. For more information you can check the following papers:
- Discovering Reliable Dependencies from Data: Hardness and Improved Algorithms, Panagiotis Mandros, Mario Boley, Jilles Vreeken, Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on Data Mining (ICDM'18) 
- Discovering Reliable Approximate Functional Dependencies , Panagiotis Mandros, Mario Boley, Jilles Vreeken, Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD conference (KDD’17)

## How to run

To discover reliable dependencies in data, refer to the readme.txt file in the discoveringDependencies folder

## How to compile

Currently the project is using a snapshot version of RealKD, therefore compiling is not currently available

## Info

This project is written in Java and build upon [RealKD](http://www.realkd.org)
